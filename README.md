Municipality Awarness Program
Our project deals through waste management solution to the problem prevailing in our city.
As we all know that the cityâ€™s MUNICIPAL CORPORATION works day and night by roaming the city unnecessarily without knowing where to take sudden actions. Same goes with us as well. We do not know who to contact or how to bring to the Co. mind where actions have to be taken.
So through our project we will be providing a medium(WEBSITE & an Android-APP) between us and municipality, through which each citizen of the city can take the initiative by informing which place has to be cleaned, roads to be repaired, filling of the pot holes, electricity wire break down, etc. Here one has to take the snap of the above mentioned problem and also share the real time location of it, for the convenience of the municipality. Through this municipality can easily track the shared locations and take sudden actions.
